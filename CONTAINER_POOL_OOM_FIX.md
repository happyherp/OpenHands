# Container Pool OOM Fix

## Problem
The original container pool implementation had a critical flaw that caused Out of Memory (OOM) issues:

1. **Infinite Loop**: When container creation failed, the `_fill_pool()` method would continue trying to create containers indefinitely
2. **No Failure Handling**: Failed container creations weren't properly tracked, causing the maintenance loop to retry every 30 seconds
3. **Resource Exhaustion**: The system would create more and more containers until the host ran out of memory

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `_fill_pool()` logic:
- It calculated how many containers were needed
- Created them concurrently using `asyncio.gather()`
- If containers failed to create, they weren't added to the pool
- The next maintenance cycle would see the pool was still empty and try again
- This created an exponential growth in container creation attempts

## Solution
Implemented multiple safeguards to prevent OOM issues:

### 1. Failure Stopping
- Changed from concurrent to sequential container creation
- Stop attempting to create more containers after the first failure
- This prevents cascading failures from overwhelming the system

### 2. Backoff Mechanism
- Added 5-minute backoff period after any container creation failure
- Prevents rapid retries that could exhaust system resources
- Automatically resets on successful container creation

### 3. Batch Limiting
- Limited container creation to maximum of 3 containers per batch
- Even with large pool sizes, only creates a manageable number at once
- Prevents sudden resource spikes

### 4. Improved Error Handling
- Better logging to track container creation progress
- Proper exception handling to prevent silent failures
- Clear warning messages when container creation fails

## Code Changes

### Before (Problematic)
```python
# Create containers concurrently
tasks = []
for _ in range(needed):
    task = asyncio.create_task(self._create_pooled_container())
    tasks.append(task)

# Wait for all containers to be created
results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
# No proper failure handling - would retry infinitely
```

### After (Fixed)
```python
# Create containers one by one with failure handling
success_count = 0
for i in range(containers_to_create):
    try:
        result = await self._create_pooled_container()
        if result is not None:
            success_count += 1
        else:
            # Stop on first failure to prevent infinite loops
            self._last_failure_time = current_time
            break
    except Exception as e:
        # Stop on exceptions
        self._last_failure_time = current_time
        break
```

## Testing
Created comprehensive tests to verify the fixes:
- ✅ Container creation stops after first failure
- ✅ Backoff mechanism prevents rapid retries
- ✅ Batch limiting prevents resource exhaustion
- ✅ Normal operation works correctly

## Impact
- **Prevents OOM**: No more infinite container creation
- **Resource Efficient**: Limited batch sizes prevent resource spikes
- **Resilient**: Graceful handling of container creation failures
- **Backward Compatible**: No changes to public API

This fix addresses the critical OOM issue reported in PR #21 while maintaining all the performance benefits of the container pool feature.
